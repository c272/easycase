    <p>Over the past couple days, after 0.2.4 dropped, I’ve been working on some actual brand-new features for the next release. So, I decided to begin adding in Cross Examinations and some other final in-court features. At the moment, here’s what the main screen looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jwSl9U3.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>It’s pretty obvious what the new button is, considering its massive on-screen size. This allows you to start a cross-examination in the court room, after a witness has given testimony (or at any time in the court, technically you could get the judge to testify). When starting your cross examination, you can also pick the name of the testimony, and the prosecutor/attorney who are facing each other off on the start screen.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VySJqOc.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Here’s an actual in-game screenshot of that:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FvBB5n5.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><em>Bear in mind that if you pick two prosecutors or two attorneys, they’re going to be facing the same way, so it’s not always an optimal choice. This may be patched out in a later update.</em></p>
<p>I’ve also added the option for you to hand a penalty out to the attorney, for instance when a wrong answer is given, you can now give them a citation for an amount of damage. If that damage hits zero, you can play a sequence, however that isn’t programmed in yet. Here’s a look at that:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ESlK0Ym.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Ignore the glitching in the character box, that was my experimentation into custom characters (more on that in a later update). However, that’s all I have to show for now. I’ll be back in a few days with more updates on development.<br>Adieu.</p>
