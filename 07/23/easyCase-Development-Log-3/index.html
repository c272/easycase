    <p>Here with a new update again.<br>For this update, I’ve been ironing out a lot of the problems with text, and finishing off all the messaging features before moving onto the trial and case systems.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick screenshot of the latest build:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cGmnjyN.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>As you can see, there are now the balloons that often appear around the games (“OBJECTION!”, “TAKE THAT!”, and “HOLD IT!”) along with their sound effects. For some reason, Phoenix’s “HOLD IT!” doesn’t appear to be included with the default SFX, so I’ve had to manually add it in via. a custom wave file. Lacking this, the engine defaults to Mia’s “HOLD IT!” sound. (Yeah, it’s not a pretty solution, but it works. I’ll have to fix it later, right now, I’m intent on getting a beta build out to users.)</p>
<p>You can also use custom sound effects in the engine now, too. Clicking on “Other SFX” brings up a menu which allows you to add extra external sound effects, as long as they’re:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wave files (.wav)</li>
<li>Within the parent directory of “AIGE.exe”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a quick look:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4rZAyTx.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>All games created within easyCase now begin with a splash screen and options to create a new game, load or exit. A default placeholder image is used when nothing’s supplied. You can now also edit the name of the game, and the name of the banner image, through a “Game Properties” menu in the “Edit” section at the top of the window.</p>

<p>That’s all I have to report for now.<br>A beta build will be rolling out in the other subforum within the next couple days, but on a limited basis. I’ll be giving out the downloads on a per-user basis, just for now, so that I can gather testing data and feedback, and then I’ll be moving to a global release when I feel that the program’s ready.</p>
<p>If you want to sign yourself up to the beta program right now, before the post goes live, DM me on Court Records, or contact me on Discord at “king d#4405”.</p>
<p>Back soon.</p>
