    <p>Big day’s here, folks!<br>easyCase Casemaker’s going up for a closed beta. I feel that the feature set’s decent enough that I can begin rolling out patches and new releases to a select group of testers, and get sufficient feedback. So, I’ll be posting to the “Games” subforum for the release side of things, but will maintain this thread for development purposes.</p>
<p>As for the state of the program at release, there’s a few features that have been added since the last post I made here, and here’s the (pretty much) full list:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now create blank cases and exit via. the “File” menu. The “Close Window” button is now disabled temporarily, as currently, all threads must be manually terminated. Apologies.</li>
<li>Music has been added to the GUI! This means that you can now load and stop custom MP3 tracks within easyCase.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused easyCase to crash after a load then a save, caused by an incorrectly placed variable change.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with setting the current character in the game causing the name box to be set automatically to Phoenix at certain times.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which allowed the user to accidentally corrupt their project file by including special characters in their project name.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug pertaining to the in-app news screen, causing it to break and throw an exception.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which would cause users to stay in an infinite loop if they got the piece of evidence to present incorrect.</li>
<li>Added loading cases into easyCase. You can now load cases that you have previously worked on by selecting their folder in the “Load” prompt menu.<br><em>This feature will be unstable. Cases may corrupt/function incorrectly after loads at this time.</em></li>
<li>Added “config.ezc” as a save file to the case directory. If you have an existing case from 0.2.0, it will carry over automatically.</li>
<li>Added presenting evidence! Evidence can now be drawn from the user, when they’re questioned on it. If the correct piece of evidence is selected, the trial continues. If an incorrect piece of evidence is selected, a user-defined set of instructions play.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which allowed users to bypass the evidence present window, thereby breaking the entire case past that point.</li>
<li>Added Trucy Wright and Ema Skye (Young) as included characters for test purposes. You can now also hold conversations between two onscreen characters as a result.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Trucy’s name box to display a blank piece of text when used directly after evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main screen has also changed a little, and now looks like this:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VDTLpe0.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>There’s also a revamped error message system, which shows a popup rather than writing to the console box on the right, and contains a little Magatama symbol. Cutesy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope to see you all over on the beta release thread for signups soon.<br>For anyone who’s testing the program, a feedback form will be sent to you along with the release!</p>
