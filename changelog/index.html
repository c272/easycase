<h1><strong>easyCase Updates</strong></h1>
<hr />
<h2>v0.3.2</h2>
<p>This is the seventh pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and is more of a UI update and general bugfix and quality of life patch at the same time. The console has had a major overhaul and is now much better looking and functioning properly, and custom text is now usable for "typewriter" entries into scenes and differing colours depending on person, etc.</p>
<p>The official easyCase release looms closer and closer, and I hope to get the entire thing out as an <strong>open</strong> beta for people by at least December this year. Now that that's out the way, here's the patch notes:</p>
<p><strong><em>Features:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Complete overhaul</em>&nbsp;of the console, including a new context menu option and non-erasable text.</li>
<li>Added a new&nbsp;<strong>custom dialogue</strong>&nbsp;feature, which allows for colour variants and different text types.</li>
<li>Added a&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Hide character&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;function for ease of use.</li>
<li>Added a new&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Delete&rdquo; and more context options</strong>&nbsp;for individual commands in the easyCase console pipeline.</li>
<li>Added a&nbsp;<strong>new debug window</strong>&nbsp;for troubleshooting while using easyCase.</li>
<li>Finished the&nbsp;<strong>7Z and ZIP</strong>&nbsp;options to export, as well as EXE.</li>
<li>Changed the&nbsp;<strong>layout of the main screen</strong>&nbsp;to be more compact, and allow for more features to be added later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Bug Fixes/Quality of Life:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Integrated the DLL dependencies into the program executable, so they no longer have to be included with the program.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you were unable to continue a court case after opening a saved project.</li>
<li>Changed the window elements so they will scale properly on large monitors.</li>
<li>Options for text alignment, color, and shaking/flashing.</li>
<li>Fixed an error where the first item in a court scene would not be blocked out correctly.</li>
<li>Added a loading bar to exported executables.</li>
<li>Migrated the court location changer into a combo box to avoid needless spaghetti code.</li>
<li>Changed the court location selector to not allow you to go to the same location twice.</li>
<li>Updated some developer-only flags and functions pertaining to the court movement system.</li>
<li>Swapped the &ldquo;version&rdquo; text on the about screen to &ldquo;build&rdquo; text for reduced clutter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a gavel hit would not register after first starting a court scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>
<p>This is a limited version of the software, and not really fit for release, rather testing. Well, that's all folks. I'll be updating the software as it moves along, and adding test editions. For now, adieu.</p>

<h2>v0.3.0</h2>
<p>This is the sixth pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and completely changes most of the features of the editor, refactoring the GUI almost entirely. This may make previous documentation on the editor inaccurate, which is a shame, but it had to be done to improve the way the editor works and its functionality. Custom backgrounds are now FINALLY available! I've been putting them off for so long, and they're now in a live build. All dependencies have also been updated to their latest versions, and the website for easyCase has been changed from <a href="http://easycase.me">http://easycase.me</a>&nbsp;to <a href="http://c272.github.io/easycase">http://c272.github.io/easycase.</a>&nbsp;Without further ado, here's the patch notes for the third major iteration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Migrated most of the UI</strong> into context elements instead of buttons.</li>
<li>Added <strong>custom backgrounds</strong> as an available background option.</li>
<li>Added the option to <strong>export the finished project</strong> to a portable SFX executable.</li>
<li><strong>Changed the website for easyCase</strong> changelogs to the new GitHub repository.</li>
<li><strong>Added a "Help" context menu</strong> for anyone unsure of what to do while using the program.</li>
<li>Changed the "Pose Char" menu to not force you to pick the currently active character,<br />rather get it from system memory.</li>
<li>Added a "currentChar.onScreen" system method for easier access.</li>
<li>Ported over to the latest version of the SIOClientDotNet, EIOClientDotNet, Immutable and Newtonsoft packages.</li>
<li>Fixed the "hasLoadedFile" check sometimes failing due to header errors.</li>
<li>Swapped out LOTS of unoptimized full-string "else if" checks (THE HORROR) for switches and enums.</li>
<li>Fixed the memory leak when presenting evidence for failure.</li>
<li>Edited the "about" menu to contain the build version number rather than the live version number.</li>
<li>Added the "makesfx.exe" dependency and license.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>
<p>This is a limited version of the software, and not really fit for release, rather testing. Well, that's all folks. I'll be updating the software as it moves along, and adding test editions. For now, adieu.</p>

<h2>v0.2.4</h2>
<p>This is the fifth pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and is more of a cosmetic and bugfixing update. Many of the bugs present in 0.2.3 were patched out, and a new update notification system has been rolled in alongside some compatibility DLLs for further down the line. The potential for a Linux port is also there, which is something i'm keeping in the back of my mind for now. The new easyCase website's also up at <a href="http://easycase.me,">http://easycase.me,</a>&nbsp;and the icon/logo has changed. Here's the full changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now add <strong>pauses</strong> within your case!</li>
<li>An <strong>update notification tool</strong> is now bundled with easyCase, which should make it easier to push out updates.</li>
<li>The <strong>easyCase website</strong> is now up for beta members, at&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="http://easycase.me/">http://easycase.me</a></li>
<li>Added an <strong>"About" tab</strong> to the main easyCase window.</li>
<li><strong>Changed the logo/icon</strong> to a more updated version.</li>
<li>Fixed the "HOLD IT!" bubble having an extended delay.</li>
<li>Un-broke the run function, after folderLocation was accidentally reset after when running in 0.2.3.</li>
<li>Fixed an error with the witness character statement not including a "\n".</li>
<li>Fixed testimonies getting stuck after start.</li>
<li>Fixed an error with the testimony engage statement not including a "\n".</li>
<li>Stopped the message box appearing during testimony popup.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the gavel being hid underneath the message box.</li>
<li>Fixed a specific use case where the gavel became stuck on screen.</li>
<li>Removed the placeholder text in "End Testimony".</li>
<li>Stopped an invalid court slide case from occurring.</li>
<li>Added a "currentCharacter" global for easy access.</li>
<li>Fixed that when opening a new window, not all critical variables would be reset.</li>
<li>Prevented a corrupted config.ezc being made when invalid characters were input into easyCase.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>

<h2>Hotfix v0.2.2b</h2>
<p>This is the fourth pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and is a small patch for the update that went live yesterday. The update broke a number of features within the program, so has been rescinded, and this hotfix is now live instead. This hotfix changes the following patch notes.</p>

<li>Revised the version of easyPWLib used for the update, as the incorrect one was copied previously.</li>
</ul>
