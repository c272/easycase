<h1><strong>easyCase Updates</strong></h1>
<hr />
<h2>v0.3.0</h2>
<p>This is the sixth pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and completely changes most of the features of the editor, refactoring the GUI almost entirely. This may make previous documentation on the editor inaccurate, which is a shame, but it had to be done to improve the way the editor works and its functionality. Custom backgrounds are now FINALLY available! I've been putting them off for so long, and they're now in a live build. All dependencies have also been updated to their latest versions, and the website for easyCase has been changed from <a href="http://easycase.me">http://easycase.me</a>&nbsp;to <a href="http://c272.github.io/easycase">http://c272.github.io/easycase.</a>&nbsp;Without further ado, here's the patch notes for the third major iteration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Migrated most of the UI</strong> into context elements instead of buttons.</li>
<li>Added <strong>custom backgrounds</strong> as an available background option.</li>
<li>Added the option to <strong>export the finished project</strong> to a portable SFX executable.</li>
<li><strong>Changed the website for easyCase</strong> changelogs to the new GitHub repository.</li>
<li><strong>Added a "Help" context menu</strong> for anyone unsure of what to do while using the program.</li>
<li>Changed the "Pose Char" menu to not force you to pick the currently active character,<br />rather get it from system memory.</li>
<li>Added a "currentChar.onScreen" system method for easier access.</li>
<li>Ported over to the latest version of the SIOClientDotNet, EIOClientDotNet, Immutable and Newtonsoft packages.</li>
<li>Fixed the "hasLoadedFile" check sometimes failing due to header errors.</li>
<li>Swapped out LOTS of unoptimized full-string "else if" checks (THE HORROR) for switches and enums.</li>
<li>Fixed the memory leak when presenting evidence for failure.</li>
<li>Edited the "about" menu to contain the build version number rather than the live version number.</li>
<li>Added the "makesfx.exe" dependency and license.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>
<p>This is a limited version of the software, and not really fit for release, rather testing. Well, that's all folks. I'll be updating the software as it moves along, and adding test editions. For now, adieu.</p>

<h2>v0.2.4</h2>
<p>This is the fifth pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and is more of a cosmetic and bugfixing update. Many of the bugs present in 0.2.3 were patched out, and a new update notification system has been rolled in alongside some compatibility DLLs for further down the line. The potential for a Linux port is also there, which is something i'm keeping in the back of my mind for now. The new easyCase website's also up at <a href="http://easycase.me,">http://easycase.me,</a>&nbsp;and the icon/logo has changed. Here's the full changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now add <strong>pauses</strong> within your case!</li>
<li>An <strong>update notification tool</strong> is now bundled with easyCase, which should make it easier to push out updates.</li>
<li>The <strong>easyCase website</strong> is now up for beta members, at&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="http://easycase.me/">http://easycase.me</a></li>
<li>Added an <strong>"About" tab</strong> to the main easyCase window.</li>
<li><strong>Changed the logo/icon</strong> to a more updated version.</li>
<li>Fixed the "HOLD IT!" bubble having an extended delay.</li>
<li>Un-broke the run function, after folderLocation was accidentally reset after when running in 0.2.3.</li>
<li>Fixed an error with the witness character statement not including a "\n".</li>
<li>Fixed testimonies getting stuck after start.</li>
<li>Fixed an error with the testimony engage statement not including a "\n".</li>
<li>Stopped the message box appearing during testimony popup.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the gavel being hid underneath the message box.</li>
<li>Fixed a specific use case where the gavel became stuck on screen.</li>
<li>Removed the placeholder text in "End Testimony".</li>
<li>Stopped an invalid court slide case from occurring.</li>
<li>Added a "currentCharacter" global for easy access.</li>
<li>Fixed that when opening a new window, not all critical variables would be reset.</li>
<li>Prevented a corrupted config.ezc being made when invalid characters were input into easyCase.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>

<h2>Hotfix v0.2.2b</h2>
<p>This is the fourth pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and is a small patch for the update that went live yesterday. The update broke a number of features within the program, so has been rescinded, and this hotfix is now live instead. This hotfix changes the following patch notes.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug when running cases from within easyCase, having the .LNK file point to an invalid directory every time.</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistencies in the PWLib engine processing which was preventing backgrounds from loading properly.</li>
<li>Removed some characters for further optimization and code analysis, as their scripts seem to break some in-engine features of AIGE. These will be readded at a later date.</li>
<li>Revised the version of easyPWLib used for the update, as the incorrect one was copied previously.</li>
</ul>

<h2>v0.2.1</h2>
<p>This is the second pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and will be released as the beta version for public testing. Again, this will be a very unstable and limited version of the program, and downloads are again hosted through several mirrors, available through the developer. If any link goes down, please contact <a href="mailto:c272github@gmail.com">c272github@gmail.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Patch Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now&nbsp;<strong>create blank cases&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>exit&nbsp;</strong>via. the "File" menu. The "Close Window" button is now disabled temporarily, as currently, all threads must be manually terminated. Apologies.</li>
<li><strong>Music&nbsp;</strong><strong>has been added&nbsp;</strong>to the GUI! This means that you can now load and stop custom MP3 tracks within easyCase.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused easyCase to crash after a load then a save, caused by an incorrectly placed variable change.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with setting the current character in the game causing the name box to be set automatically to Phoenix at certain times.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug pertaining to the in-app news screen, causing it to break and throw an exception.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which would cause users to stay in an infinite loop if they got the piece of evidence to present incorrect.</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;<strong>loading cases&nbsp;</strong>into easyCase. You can now load cases that you have previously worked on by selecting their folder in the "Load" prompt menu.<br /><em>This feature will be unstable. Cases may corrupt/function incorrectly after loads at this time.</em></li>
<li>Added "config.ezc" as a save file to the case directory. If you have an existing case from 0.2.0, it will carry over automatically.</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;<strong>presenting evidence!&nbsp;</strong>Evidence can now be drawn from the user, when they're questioned on it. If the correct piece of evidence is selected, the trial continues. If an incorrect piece of evidence is selected, a user-defined set of instructions play.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which allowed users to bypass the evidence present window, thereby breaking the entire case past that point.</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;<strong>Trucy Wright and Ema Skye (Young)&nbsp;</strong>as included characters for test purposes. You can now also hold conversations between two onscreen characters as a result.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Trucy's name box to display a blank piece of text when used directly after evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>
