<h1><strong>easyCase Updates</strong></h1>
<hr />
<h2>v0.2.4</h2>
<p>This is the fifth pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and is more of a cosmetic and bugfixing update. Many of the bugs present in 0.2.3 were patched out, and a new update notification system has been rolled in alongside some compatibility DLLs for further down the line. The potential for a Linux port is also there, which is something i'm keeping in the back of my mind for now. The new easyCase website's also up at <a href="http://easycase.me,">http://easycase.me,</a>&nbsp;and the icon/logo has changed. Here's the full changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now add <strong>pauses</strong> within your case!</li>
<li>An <strong>update notification tool</strong> is now bundled with easyCase, which should make it easier to push out updates.</li>
<li>The <strong>easyCase website</strong> is now up for beta members, at&nbsp;<a class="postlink" href="http://easycase.me/">http://easycase.me</a></li>
<li>Added an <strong>"About" tab</strong> to the main easyCase window.</li>
<li><strong>Changed the logo/icon</strong> to a more updated version.</li>
<li>Fixed the "HOLD IT!" bubble having an extended delay.</li>
<li>Un-broke the run function, after folderLocation was accidentally reset after when running in 0.2.3.</li>
<li>Fixed an error with the witness character statement not including a "\n".</li>
<li>Fixed testimonies getting stuck after start.</li>
<li>Fixed an error with the testimony engage statement not including a "\n".</li>
<li>Stopped the message box appearing during testimony popup.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the gavel being hid underneath the message box.</li>
<li>Fixed a specific use case where the gavel became stuck on screen.</li>
<li>Removed the placeholder text in "End Testimony".</li>
<li>Stopped an invalid court slide case from occurring.</li>
<li>Added a "currentCharacter" global for easy access.</li>
<li>Fixed that when opening a new window, not all critical variables would be reset.</li>
<li>Prevented a corrupted config.ezc being made when invalid characters were input into easyCase.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>
<p>This is a limited version of the software, and not really fit for release, rather testing. Well, that's all folks. I'll be updating the software as it moves along, and adding test editions. For now, adieu.</p>

<h2>Hotfix v0.2.2b</h2>
<p>This is the fourth pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and is a small patch for the update that went live yesterday. The update broke a number of features within the program, so has been rescinded, and this hotfix is now live instead. This hotfix changes the following patch notes.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug when running cases from within easyCase, having the .LNK file point to an invalid directory every time.</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistencies in the PWLib engine processing which was preventing backgrounds from loading properly.</li>
<li>Removed some characters for further optimization and code analysis, as their scripts seem to break some in-engine features of AIGE. These will be readded at a later date.</li>
<li>Revised the version of easyPWLib used for the update, as the incorrect one was copied previously.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>v0.2.1</h2>
<p>This is the second pre-release build for easyCase Casemaker, and will be released as the beta version for public testing. Again, this will be a very unstable and limited version of the program, and downloads are again hosted through several mirrors, available through the developer. If any link goes down, please contact <a href="mailto:c272github@gmail.com">c272github@gmail.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Patch Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now&nbsp;<strong>create blank cases&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>exit&nbsp;</strong>via. the "File" menu. The "Close Window" button is now disabled temporarily, as currently, all threads must be manually terminated. Apologies.</li>
<li><strong>Music&nbsp;</strong><strong>has been added&nbsp;</strong>to the GUI! This means that you can now load and stop custom MP3 tracks within easyCase.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused easyCase to crash after a load then a save, caused by an incorrectly placed variable change.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with setting the current character in the game causing the name box to be set automatically to Phoenix at certain times.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which allowed the user to accidentally corrupt their project file by including special characters in their project name.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug pertaining to the in-app news screen, causing it to break and throw an exception.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which would cause users to stay in an infinite loop if they got the piece of evidence to present incorrect.</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;<strong>loading cases&nbsp;</strong>into easyCase. You can now load cases that you have previously worked on by selecting their folder in the "Load" prompt menu.<br /><em>This feature will be unstable. Cases may corrupt/function incorrectly after loads at this time.</em></li>
<li>Added "config.ezc" as a save file to the case directory. If you have an existing case from 0.2.0, it will carry over automatically.</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;<strong>presenting evidence!&nbsp;</strong>Evidence can now be drawn from the user, when they're questioned on it. If the correct piece of evidence is selected, the trial continues. If an incorrect piece of evidence is selected, a user-defined set of instructions play.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which allowed users to bypass the evidence present window, thereby breaking the entire case past that point.</li>
<li>Added&nbsp;<strong>Trucy Wright and Ema Skye (Young)&nbsp;</strong>as included characters for test purposes. You can now also hold conversations between two onscreen characters as a result.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Trucy's name box to display a blank piece of text when used directly after evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this version by contacting the developer on the Court Records forums, or via. Discord, at king d#4405. This is a beta release, and&nbsp;<em>not to be circulated around the community.&nbsp;</em>Doing so will remove you from the beta program.</p>
