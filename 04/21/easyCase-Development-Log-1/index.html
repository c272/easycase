<p>Since the Ace Attorney Discord isn’t the best place to post this kind of stuff, and I feel that it’s appropriate that people who care know what i’m doing on this project, I’m opening this site to post my developments on the easyCase framework, built around KSA Technology’s previous PWLib library for the Anime Image Game Engine.</p>
<p>This is a GUI centred program which will enable you to create cases in PWLib using a graphical interface, rather than using the scripting method that’s set out for it. Yes, this won’t be the most code-efficient method of creating cases, but I feel that it’ll be an easy way for either veterans who want to speed up their workflow to create cases, or new people starting out which are constantly searching for threads on MB’s Casemaker. (Yes, the forbidden name).</p>
<p>I’ll be posting updates on development as well as release scheduling here, and provide download links either internally or externally when required. Here’s a first look at the program right now, even if it is [i]extremely[/i] early in development:</p>

<p>The feature set here is obviously severely lacking, but it works as a proof of concept. When saved, using the “File” tab at the top of the window, a new instance of PWLib is created in the selected folder, and the script is then flushed to file and can then be run, with no further configuration, from “AIGE.exe” in the save location. Currently you can only set the title, but all initialisation of required scripts, etc. is done by the program itself, rather than by a user manually typing the script in, which I feel is extremely useful. AIGE boots and loads PWLib completely fine from one of these saves.</p>
<p>The program also only uses ~20-22MB of memory as of current, which I aim to keep extremely low as to make it lightweight and usable on lots of systems.</p>

<p>I’ll post more updates here when I have them, and the program is nearing a usable state.<br>In the meantime, have a good one.</p>
