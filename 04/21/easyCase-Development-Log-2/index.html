    <p>Progress has been made quickly toward a functional build.<br>Today, I managed to add a title changing function, along with functions to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Characters</li>
<li>Change Character Poses</li>
<li>Change Active Character (character on screen)</li>
<li>Show Message Box</li>
<li>Hide Message Box</li>
<li>Change Background</li>
<li>Give Evidence to Player</li>
<li>Message as the Active Character</li>
<li>Message as Phoenix</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, development has been extremely limited, and you can currently only have Phoenix as the player character, along with only having 1 or 2 pieces of evidence available. However, this will change when I find the time to add all the different IDs and paths in for all the evidences, and make the player’s name changeable.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick screenshot of it in action:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mindREa.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Loading an existing project is currently not available, and likely won’t be for quite a while, as I’ll have to build an interpreter to read through an existing .HLSL file and output the necessary jargon to console, which will have to be done after I’ve built a complete feature set. Here, you can see that adding and focusing different characters is entirely possible:</p>

<p>And the game is currently booting and loading:</p>

<p>Giving evidence to the player is also done via. an external window, where you choose which piece of evidence you want the player to have, and give it a description. I’ll extend this in the future so that you can choose custom names and pictures for evidence.</p>

<p>That’s all for now.<br>I’ll report back soon with more progress updates, as development continues.</p>
