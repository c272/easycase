0.0.5|Thanks for using the easyCase beta. Quick second hotfix to fix a few issues with PWLib characters and SFX.

CHANGELOG:
- Made the preview loader prefer the project directory's images over the source.
- Fixed bug where the "SFX-" sounds would not play properly.
- Added support for window size changes in the project editor.
- Changed the compiler to support window size changes.
- Updated the backend structure for projects.

Also, quick note:
DON'T ATTEMPT TO LOAD PREVIOUS PROJECTS IN THE NEW BUILD!
This may cause errors.

That's all for this update, a more detailed one coming for this week's weekly build next weekend.
