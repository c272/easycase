0.0.4|Thanks for using the easyCase beta. This is the first hotfix, and contains some vital changes.

CHANGELOG:
- Added a "Hide Name Box" option to remove the name box from screen.
- Fixed bug where the "Jump To" action IDs would be limited to 100 on some menus.
- Fixed the AIGE window being enlarged too far for the game.
- Made sound effect pathing work properly, SFX should now play correctly.

That's all for this update, a more detailed one coming for this week's weekly build next weekend.
