0.0.6|Thanks for using the easyCase beta. This is the first "major" weekly build! Future builds will increase the minor version number (v0.x.0), but since this one wasn't that large (exam week), I figured I'd keep it the same. Still, there are some new features available!

CHANGELOG:
- Added CUSTOM FUNCTIONS, which are now available through the function editor.
- Added custom SOUND/MUSIC SUPPORT to the editor.
- Fixed lipsync breaking on some specific poses.
- Updated the compiler structure to support a wider variety of scripts.
- Many small reported bugfixes.

That's all for this update, I'll be preparing a larger one for next week's release now that exams are over. Bye!
